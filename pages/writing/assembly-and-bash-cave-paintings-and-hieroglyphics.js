  <p><b>Assembly Code (Cave Paintings) - </b>You can tell that these programs are computer code, and that they used to mean something to someone. However, one can only speculate as to their original purpose. There may be references to rituals and incantations trying to communicate with compilers past. You've heard that similar paintings are still being created, but they seem to lack the handmade, genuine touch of those created by the ancients.</p><p><b>Bash (Hieroglyphics) - </b>The meaning of these symbols is much more obvious than those in assembly code. One can with a &nbsp;basic understanding of programming history and culture&nbsp;ascertain&nbsp;the general intention put forth in these bash programs, though every nuance may not be completely understood. Still, the archeologist is left wondering, why were some of the more massive works did not inspire their creators to use a more expressive language (since silicon-dating technologies indicate that these technologies definitely existed at the time of writing).</p>
