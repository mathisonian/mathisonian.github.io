            I worked with researchers and communications experts at NASA JPL to help design new ways of visualizing the massive
            quantities of climate change, like the <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2933/visualizing-the-quantities-of-climate-change/">amount of ice that has melted</a> or the <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3020/how-much-carbon-dioxide-are-we-emitting/">tons of COâ‚‚ emitted</a> due to human activity.
